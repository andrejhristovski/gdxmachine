### JVM based 2D Game Engine
GdxMachine is open source 2D game engine built on top of popular JVM based framework for game development
[libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/).

The main goal is to reach maximum performance on Desktop & Android without implementing platform specific code.
Also to provide beginner friendly API for rapid game development.

## Getting started
- Create gradle project using Intellij IDEA
- Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
- add the dependencies
```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.disgraded.gdxmachine:platform-desktop:0.0.6-prototype'
    implementation 'com.github.disgraded.gdxmachine:core:0.0.6-prototype'
}
```
